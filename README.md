## 1. Project Overview

This project provides practical implementations of various basic machine learning models for binary classification. It utilizes the well-known Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset to demonstrate core machine learning concepts such as data loading, preprocessing, model selection, training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation. The primary goal is to create an educational resource that is easy to understand, follow, and reproduce.

## 2. Dataset

The Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset is a publicly available dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains 30 features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of a breast mass, as well as class labels indicating whether the mass is malignant or benign. It is a commonly used dataset for practicing classification models, as it is relatively clean and has a real world application.

*   **Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic))
*   **Number of Instances:** 569
*   **Number of Features:** 30 numerical features
*   **Classes:** 2 (Malignant, Benign)

## 3. Models Implemented

The following machine learning models are implemented in this repository:

*   **Logistic Regression:** A linear model for binary classification.
*   **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** A distance-based classification algorithm.
*   **Decision Tree:** A tree-based model for decision-making.
*   **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** A classification model that uses a hyperplane to separate classes.
*   **Naive Bayes:** A simple probabilistic model for classification.
*   **Random Forest:** An ensemble method combining multiple decision trees.
*   **Gradient Boosting:** An ensemble method that combines weak learners into a strong learner.
